   <h2><p>Hey everyone!</p><p>I'm incredibly excited to meet you all and get started on this coding adventure.
       I quit my job in digital journalism at Dataminr in London to move back here and take this course over the summer. 
       I moved to Atlanta as a teenager and very much call this place home. I do intend to move back to London later this year, but 
       I cannot wait to be armed with a new skillset and life drive.</p>
       <p>Here's some of my previous experience:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Dataminr - London: Ran newsroom where we unearthed breaking news social media content ahead of any traditional platform </li>
           <li>Joinup - Atlanta: Founded and created mobile app designed geolocate and match-make people for pick-up sports games (based in Tech village briefly!)</li>
           <li>Al Jazeera America - New York: Worked on the news desk for the launch of this network</li>
           <li>CNN - Atlanta: Worked on domestic and international news desk for breaking news</li>
       </ul>
